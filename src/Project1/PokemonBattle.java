                    Name: Lukas Maynard
                    Data Structures Date: Date of Submission (2/7/2023)
 *************************************************************
        User inputs odd number of rounds to prevent tie. Then player1 and player2 input pokemon info.
        After determining who gos first by attack speed the attack sequence, the attacks by both players
        happen until one player's hitPoints are zero indicating the other player wins the round. Rounds
        continue until all are complete. Player with more rounds won, wins!
 *************************************************************
            PokemonBattle::main()
        Parameters: None
        Insures input round amount is a round number. Uses a series of loops to execute amount of rounds,
        needed input, math for the attacks, and output.

            PokemonBattle::whosFaster()
        Parameters: Player[] class List
        Determines what player has higher attack speed using the player instances. Returns array with player order.

            PokemonBattle::Player{}
        Parameters: None
        Used to create player instance containing: name, hitPoints, move, movePower,and attackSpeed.
